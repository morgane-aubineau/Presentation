    <p class="abstract"> <strong>Abstract.</strong> <strong><em>Introduction.</em></strong> An increasing number of students diagnosed with autistic spectrum conditions (ASC) now attend mainstream high schools in both France and Quebec. However, little is known about how these teenagers cope with different aspects of inclusion. _**Objectives.**_ (1) Describe their experiences of self-perception and friendship relationships (2) Examine student social representation profiles as a function of their individual characteristics and environmental variables. <strong><em>Methods.</em></strong> 23 autistic students (age range 12–16 years) collaborated in the study. All of them attended high school full-time, in France(n = 15) and in Quebec (n = 8). Youths filled out a French version of the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents questionnaire (SPPA; Harter, 1988),and the Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS; Bukowski et al., 1994). <strong><em>Results.</em></strong> Cluster analyses identified 4 modes of representation on the SPPA scales: “school performance depreciating” (n = 8), “school-work oriented” (n = 5), “low self-esteem” (n = 4) and “sociable” (n = 6).The 3 FQS clusters were labeled “socially isolated” (n = 8), “friendly engaged” (n = 7) and “insecure with conflict” (n = 8). Despite the identical mean score for “global self-worth” in both “friendly engaged” and “school-work oriented” groups, the “friendly engaged” group shows higher mean scores in almost all dimensions measured by SPPA. The results show a positive effect of social skills training on self-perception. Significant differences between profiles (for both SPPA and FQS) are found regarding (1) family sociodemographic data and (2) social and relationship sphere. <strong><em>Conclusion.</em></strong> This study underscores the importance of taking into account diversity in ASC adolescent representational profiles and social adaptation strategies. Results underscore the importance of understanding friendship relationships and their influence on a satisfying self-perception. The diversity of self-evaluations of friendships and self-concept suggest that self-assertion and social skills training focusing on high functioning autistic youth’s specific problems in high school mainstream programs might be an important pathway to successful inclusion and academic perseverance.</p>

    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract.</strong> <strong><em>Background.</em></strong> An increasing number of autistic students attend mainstream secondary schools in both France and Quebec. The importance of considering their views on subjects that affect their daily life is now well established in education research. Still, little is known about how these students cope with specific aspects of inclusion. <strong><em>Objective.</em></strong> This article explores the school experience of teenagers, considered as “the most expert, most capable of telling what it is like to be them” (Speraw, p.736), regarding their academic and social inclusion. Specifically, we aim to identify inhibitors and enablers to promoting successful educational experiences in a Francophone context. <strong><em>Methods.</em></strong> 26 autistic students (aged 12 to 16), attending mainstream secondary schools in France (n=17) and Quebec (N=9), were interviewed. <strong><em>Results.</em></strong> Managing sensory aspects, perceived immature behaviours from their peers and tiredness are identified as the main hardships of school life. Being included in an intensive academic program, being driven by a passion and having a friend inside the school are reported as important enablers. <strong><em>Perspectives.</em></strong> For high functioning autistic students, transition into adult life constitutes one of the major challenges and has to be anticipated as soon as possible. Recommendations for practice are put forward to foster their empowerment and specify support needed to help them gain essential autonomy and practical skills necessary in the workplace and to be able to speak for themselves.</p>

    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract.</strong> <strong><em>Background.</em></strong> Despite international studies and governmental recommendations to involve directly youth with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) in research, their own perspective is rarely taken into account in francophone research settings. Grounded in an ecological approach where participants are acknowledged as experts and knowledge co producers, our work aims at understanding how they cope with mainstream education in high schools. <strong><em>Methods.</em></strong> 26 teenagers with ASD (13-17) and their parents (France: n=17; Quebec: n=9) took part in semi-structured in-depth interviews and completed questionnaires (Adolescents: Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS) and Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (SPPA); Parents: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and personal information sheet). <strong><em>Results.</em></strong> <em>Questionnaire analysis.</em> Cluster analysis identified 3 profiles for friendship representations, distinguished regarding companionship and help from the friend. Social acceptance, close friends and physical appearance differentiate self-perception into a 4-group typology (SPPA). The presence of a teaching assistant in class and the social skills training support are correlated positive with self and friendship representations. Satisfying parental representations are positively correlated with adolescent’ prosocial behaviors, full-time job for mothers and diagnosis of ASD in parents. <em>Thematic analysis.</em> Managing sensory aspects, perceived immature behaviors from their peers and tiredness are identified as the main obstacles for their inclusion. On the contrary, being included in an intensive academic program, being driven by a passion and having a friend appear to be important enablers. Their autistic identity is generally well lived, especially outside of high school. <strong><em>Prospects.</em></strong> Transition to adult life will constitute one of the major challenges for youth with ASD. It has to be anticipated as soon as possible to allow them to gain autonomy and practical skills to be able to speak for themselves.<br><br><strong>Keywords:</strong> Autistic spectrum conditions; adolescent’ identity formation; academic and social inclusion; student’ perspective; friendship and self-representations; social cognition; France – Quebec comparison.</p>
